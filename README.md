## Good to Know

Node 18 conflicts with webpack, because in the course the teacher uses an older version, which does not compatible with node 18. There is a summary of this problem here:

What worked for me:

1 - Update this line in every project created with the Vue CLI: "serve": "vue-cli-service serve --openssl-legacy-provider"

2 - Type this into cmd inside the project folder (in the same folder as package.json): set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
